# ecommerce-sql-portfolio project
This project simulates a mini ecommerce platform using SQL. It includes a relational database schema with realistic customer, product, and order data. This project is part of my professional SQL portfolio, and it showcases my ability to design schemas, insert meaningful data, and run business-driven SQL queries.
